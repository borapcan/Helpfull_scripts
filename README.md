# Helpful Scripts

## About Repo

This is a repo created for small helpful Scripts that solve specific problems, but are small enough to not warrant a repo for each of them. If any of the repos has any specific requirements they will be placed in requirements.txt, otherwise native python is enough to run them. Additionally if there are special installation instrucitons they will be listed in Readme specific to that script.
